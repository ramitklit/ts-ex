## Why tsdx?

Behind the scenes, why did I **Ramit** create tsdx? beacause of 2 reasons:

1. Whenever I want to create a new start-up project specially with typescript I have to build it and config it from scratch it sounds like so westing time right? of course it is. But why I am not googling to find the solution? answer: I do find and use itðŸ˜Š But Uhh not what I was looking for like they bring in like heavy heavy package that is not necessary at all. so I made this **ts-ex** lightweight package bring-in and necessary only.
2. I want to easily install and fast with just 2 clicks I got a new clean project to work with also dealing with stress too when I dont't see the unnecessary package that I'm not event use.

# Installation

```
1. npm i -g @ramit_klit/ts-ex.
2. use command ts-ex when you want to create a new project.
```

# UnInstallation

if you don't like ts-ex do this:

```
npm un -g ts-ex
```

this command will directly uninstall **ts-ex** from your local machine.

## Why named ts-ex?

Haha wired name but don't be confused I means **typescript express**.
