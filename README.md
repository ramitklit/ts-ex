## Why tsdx?
Behind the scenes, why did I **Ramit** create tsdx? beacause of 2 reasons:
1. Whenever I want to create a new start-up project specially with typescript I have to build it and config it from scratch it sounds like so westing time right? of course it is. But why I am not googling to find the solution? answer: I do find and use itðŸ˜Š But Uhh not what I was looking for like they bring in like heavy heavy package that is not necessary at all. so I made this **ts-ex** lightweight package bring-in and necessary only. 
2. I want to easily install and fast with just 2 clicks I got a new clean project to work with also dealing with stress too when I dont't see the unnecessary package that I'm not event use.

# Installation
```
1. clone the project.
2. cd in to it and run npm link.
$ done that it! to see where is the package exists? use npm list -g --depth=0 then will see ts-exðŸ¤ª
```

# UnInstallation
if you don't like tsxd do this:
```
npm un -g ts-ex
```
this command will directly uninstall **ts-ex** from your local machine yeah:(
\
if there is no any alert thank you for trying ts-ex: and I will you can come back and read this **Thanks you for trying ts-ex bye byeðŸ˜¥**

## Why named ts-ex?
